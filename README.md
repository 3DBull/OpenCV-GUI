# OpenCV-GUI
Module to create GUI for an OpenCV python program
The openCV library has a lot of good functionality for working with images, but it has no GUI functionality.
Since it is difficult to interface openCV and other GUI libraries, I built this module to provide GUI functionality on top of openCV.
The module is simple to use and includes features such as buttons, progress bars, plots, and more. 

Here is a screeenshot of what it can look like with the default look and feel.
